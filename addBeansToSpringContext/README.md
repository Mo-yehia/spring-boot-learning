# Adding Beans to the Spring Context

This folder showcases **different ways to add beans to the Spring Context** in a Spring application.

You'll find three separate files inside this folder â€” each representing a **distinct method** for bean registration:

1. **Stereotype Annotations**  
   Using annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc., along with component scanning.

2. **@Bean Annotation**  
   Defining beans explicitly within a `@Configuration` class using the `@Bean` annotation.

3. **Programmatic Registration**  
   Dynamically registering beans in code at runtime using the Spring context API.

Each file includes a minimal working example to help you understand how the respective method works.

Feel free to explore and compare these approaches to understand their use cases, benefits, and trade-offs.
