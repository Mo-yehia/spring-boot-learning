# Using Abstraction with Spring Context

This project demonstrates how to apply **Abstraction** using **Spring Context** to achieve loose coupling and better code flexibility.

## What is Abstraction in this context?

Abstraction means we define **what needs to happen** without worrying about **how it happens**.  
In Spring, this is typically done by coding against **interfaces** or **abstract classes** instead of concrete implementations.

---

## Project Overview

- We have an interface that defines a contract.
- Multiple classes can implement this interface in different ways.
- Spring handles the creation and injection of the right implementation.
